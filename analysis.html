</div>

<!-- ===== Summary calculation ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">8</span>The Calculation: Where The Extra Energy Goes</h2>
  <div class="calc-box"><span class="highlight">METHOD: known element power (3.11 kW, measured) + baseline subtraction</span>
  Each half-hour reading decomposed: household baseline = 0.14 kWh (~270W always-on),
  remainder up to 1.56 kWh (= 3.11 kW &times; 30 min) attributed to heater.
  Element run-time = heater energy &divide; 3.11 kW.

<span class="highlight">OLD REGIME (Feb&ndash;Mar 2025): 14.9 kWh/day</span>
  Heater:    9.6 kWh/day  &bull;  Element run-time: 3.1 h/day
  Household: 5.2 kWh/day  (low &mdash; early days after move-in)

<span class="highlight">SUMMER (Jul&ndash;Aug 2025): 14.6 kWh/day</span>
  Heater:    8.4 kWh/day  &bull;  Element run-time: 2.7 h/day
  Household: 6.2 kWh/day  (settled baseline)

<span class="highlight">NEW REGIME (Dec 2025&ndash;Jan 2026): 26.1 kWh/day</span>
  Heater:   18.5 kWh/day  &bull;  Element run-time: 5.9 h/day
  Household: 7.6 kWh/day  (gradual increase from more devices)

<span class="highlight">THE GAP: +11.2 kWh/day</span>
  Heater increase:    +8.9 kWh/day  (79% of gap)  &larr; TIMER REGIME CHANGE
  Household increase: +2.4 kWh/day  (21% of gap)  &larr; MORE DEVICES OVER TIME

<span class="highlight">WHY DOES THE SAME HEATER USE 2x THE ENERGY?</span>
  Old regime: element enabled ~6 h/day (in cheap-rate windows)
  New regime: element enabled ~20 h/day (24/7 minus 16&ndash;20)

  Old regime: tank held at thermostat setpoint only during windows.
              Between windows, tank cooled freely. No energy consumed.
              Average tank temperature across the day: well BELOW setpoint.
              Lower avg temp &rarr; lower heat loss rate &rarr; less energy needed.

  New regime: tank held at FULL setpoint ~20 hours/day.
              Every temperature dip immediately corrected.
              Average tank temperature across the day: AT or NEAR setpoint.
              Higher avg temp &rarr; higher heat loss rate &rarr; more energy needed.

  The old enforced off-periods acted as free temperature setback.
  The new regime eliminates that setback = more standing losses replenished.

<span class="highlight">ELEMENT: 3.11 kW (measured). Identical in both regimes.</span>
  It's not a different element. Not a changed thermostat. Not more hot water usage.
  It's purely more run-time: 3.1 h/day &rarr; 5.9 h/day.</div>
</div>

<!-- ===== CHART 9: Overnight heatmap ===== -->

  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart9"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Old regime (left):</strong> activity concentrated in the 22:00&ndash;23:00 band (cheap-rate window). Hours 00:00&ndash;03:00 are almost empty.<br>
    <strong>New regime (right):</strong> activity spreads across all overnight hours. The 22:00&ndash;01:00 band lights up as the heater recovers after the 16:00&ndash;20:00 off-window, and stays elevated until 03:00.

<!-- ===== CHART 10: Monthly cost ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">10</span>Monthly Cost: Heater vs Household</h2>
  <p class="desc">Electricity cost in &pound; decomposed using the 3.11 kW element model. Line shows heater share of total cost.</p>
  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart10"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>January 2026 peak:</strong> &pound;177.66 total &mdash; the heater alone cost <strong>&pound;99.20</strong> (56%). In summer, the heater drops to &pound;23&ndash;25/month (29&ndash;33%).<br>
    Despite lower per-kWh Agile rates in new regime (17.4p vs 21.3p), the volume increase overwhelms the rate savings.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===== Section 11: The Price Tag ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">11</span>The Price Tag: What The Regime Change Costs</h2>
  <div class="calc-box"><span class="highlight">OLD REGIME DAILY COST: &pound;3.28/day</span>
  Heater avg rate when firing: 21.3 p/kWh (mostly evening cheap-rate slots)
  Household avg rate:          22.8 p/kWh

<span class="highlight">NEW REGIME DAILY COST: &pound;4.91/day (+50%)</span>
  Heater avg rate when firing: 17.4 p/kWh (overnight slots &mdash; even cheaper!)
  Household avg rate:          20.2 p/kWh

<span class="highlight">THE PARADOX: cheaper rates, higher bills.</span>
  The new regime fires the heater during cheaper overnight hours (17.4p vs 21.3p),
  BUT the element runs nearly 2x as long (5.9h vs 3.1h), so total cost rises 50%.

<span class="highlight">EXTRA COST OF THE NEW REGIME:</span>
  Per day:   <span class="highlight">+&pound;1.63</span>
  Per month: <span class="highlight">+&pound;50</span>
  Per year:  <span class="highlight">+&pound;595</span>

<span class="highlight">ANNUAL ELECTRICITY BREAKDOWN:</span>
  Heater:    &pound;619  (48% of total)
  Household: &pound;659  (52% of total)
  Total:     &pound;1,277</div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Reverting to the old timer regime (element enabled only in 2&ndash;3 cheap-rate windows per day) would save roughly <strong>&pound;50/month</strong> or <strong>&pound;595/year</strong> &mdash; with no reduction in usable hot water during the hours that matter.
