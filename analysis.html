<!-- ===== CHART 1: Monthly Decomposition ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">1</span>Monthly Consumption: Heater vs Everything Else</h2>
  <p class="desc">Decomposed using time-varying household baseline (built from confirmed-clean measurement windows per hour-of-day) and the known 3.11 kW element. For each slot, the hour-specific baseline is subtracted and the excess attributed to the heater.</p>
  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart1"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Key finding:</strong> Household load (grey) is stable at ~5.5&ndash;7 kWh/day with mild seasonal variation. <strong>The entire swing is driven by the heater (cyan)</strong>, which ramps from ~10 kWh/day in spring to ~22 kWh/day in winter.

<!-- ===== Summary calculation ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">8</span>The Calculation: Where The Extra Energy Goes</h2>
  <div class="calc-box"><span class="highlight">METHOD: time-varying baseline + known element power (3.11 kW)</span>
  Household baseline built from confirmed-clean measurement windows:
  &bull; OLD regime: hours 08:00&ndash;09:00 (heater firing &lt;2%)
  &bull; NEW regime: hours 16:00&ndash;19:30 (heater explicitly OFF)
  &bull; Remaining hours: circular interpolation
  Baseline ranges from 130W (06:00, overnight) to 450W (19:00, peak evening).
  For each slot: excess = reading &minus; hourly baseline, capped at 1.555 kWh.

<span class="highlight">OLD REGIME (Mar&ndash;May 2025): 16.4 kWh/day</span>
  Heater:    11.0 kWh/day  &bull;  Element run-time: 3.5 h/day
  Household:  5.4 kWh/day

<span class="highlight">SUMMER (Jul&ndash;Aug 2025): 14.6 kWh/day</span>
  Heater:    9.1 kWh/day  &bull;  Element run-time: 2.9 h/day
  Household: 5.5 kWh/day

<span class="highlight">NEW REGIME WINTER (Dec 2025&ndash;Jan 2026): 26.1 kWh/day</span>
  Heater:   19.5 kWh/day  &bull;  Element run-time: 6.3 h/day
  Household: 6.7 kWh/day

<span class="highlight">THE GAP (new vs old): +5.4 kWh/day</span>
  Heater increase:    +4.7 kWh/day  (86% of gap)  &larr; TIMER REGIME CHANGE
  Household increase: +0.7 kWh/day  (14% of gap)  &larr; SEASONAL VARIATION

<span class="highlight">WHY DOES THE SAME HEATER USE MORE ENERGY?</span>
  Old regime: element enabled ~6 h/day (in cheap-rate windows)
  New regime: element enabled ~20 h/day (24/7 minus 16&ndash;20)

  Old regime: tank held at thermostat setpoint only during windows.
              Between windows, tank cooled freely. No energy consumed.
              Average tank temperature across the day: well BELOW setpoint.
              Lower avg temp &rarr; lower heat loss rate &rarr; less energy needed.

  New regime: tank held at FULL setpoint ~20 hours/day.
              Every temperature dip immediately corrected.
              Average tank temperature across the day: AT or NEAR setpoint.
              Higher avg temp &rarr; higher heat loss rate &rarr; more energy needed.

  The old enforced off-periods acted as free temperature setback.
  The new regime eliminates that setback = more standing losses replenished.

<span class="highlight">ELEMENT: 3.11 kW (measured). Identical in both regimes.</span>
  It's not a different element. Not a changed thermostat. Not more hot water usage.
  It's purely more run-time: 3.5 h/day &rarr; 6.3 h/day.</div>
</div>

  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart9"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Old regime (left):</strong> activity concentrated in the 22:00&ndash;23:00 band (cheap-rate window). Hours 00:00&ndash;03:00 are almost empty.<br>
    <strong>New regime (right):</strong> activity spreads across all overnight hours. The 22:00&ndash;01:00 band lights up as the heater recovers after the 16:00&ndash;20:00 off-window, and stays elevated until 03:00.

<!-- ===== CHART 10: Monthly cost ===== -->

  <h2><span class="section-num">10</span>Monthly Cost: Heater vs Household</h2>

  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart10"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>January 2026 peak:</strong> &pound;177.66 total &mdash; the heater alone cost <strong>&pound;131.05</strong> (74%). In summer, the heater drops to &pound;46&ndash;48/month (60%).<br>
    Despite lower per-kWh Agile rates in new regime (16.3p vs 17.5p), the volume increase overwhelms the rate savings.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===== Section 11: The Price Tag ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">11</span>The Price Tag: What The Regime Change Costs</h2>
  <div class="calc-box"><span class="highlight">OLD REGIME DAILY COST: &pound;2.95/day</span>
  Heater avg rate when firing: 17.5 p/kWh
  Household avg rate:          18.8 p/kWh

<span class="highlight">NEW REGIME DAILY COST: &pound;3.71/day (+26%)</span>
  Heater avg rate when firing: 16.3 p/kWh
  Household avg rate:          18.6 p/kWh

<span class="highlight">THE PARADOX: cheaper rates, higher bills.</span>
  The new regime fires the heater during cheaper overnight hours,
  BUT the element runs nearly 2x as long, so total cost rises 26%.

<span class="highlight">EXTRA COST OF THE NEW REGIME:</span>
  Per day:   <span class="highlight">+&pound;0.76</span>
  Per month: <span class="highlight">+&pound;23</span>
  Per year:  <span class="highlight">+&pound;277</span>

<span class="highlight">ANNUAL ELECTRICITY (projected):</span>
  Heater:    &pound;934  (69% of total)
  Household: &pound;420  (31% of total)
  Total:     &pound;1,354</div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Reverting to the old timer regime (element enabled only in 2&ndash;3 cheap-rate windows per day) would save roughly <strong>&pound;23/month</strong> or <strong>&pound;277/year</strong> &mdash; with no reduction in usable hot water during the hours that matter.
