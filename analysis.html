<h1>Immersion Heater: Why Is It Using 2x The Energy?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Deep-dive analysis of electricity usage data &middot; Feb 2025 &ndash; Feb 2026 &middot; 18,240 half-hourly readings</p>

<!-- ===== CHART 1: Monthly Decomposition ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">1</span>Monthly Consumption: Heater vs Everything Else</h2>
  <p class="desc">Readings &gt;0.8 kWh per half-hour classified as heater (immersion element is ~3 kW, producing ~1.5 kWh when on for a full slot). Everything &le;0.8 kWh is household loads.</p>
  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart1"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Key finding:</strong> The "other" load (grey) stabilises at ~10&ndash;11.5 kWh/day from June onwards and barely changes between summer and deep winter. <strong>The entire seasonal swing is driven by the heater (cyan).</strong>
  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>The element draws the same ~2.8 kW in both regimes.</strong> It hasn't changed. What changed is that it fires for <strong>5.6 hours/day</strong> in new winter vs <strong>2.7 hours/day</strong> in old winter &mdash; more than double.

    <strong>Old regime:</strong> sharp spike at 20:00&ndash;22:30 (heater in the 19&ndash;22 cheap window), small bump at 06:00&ndash;07:00. Rest of the day near-idle.<br>
    <strong>New regime:</strong> massive overnight plateau 21:00&ndash;02:00 (heater recovering after 16&ndash;20 off-window), plus elevated baseline all day from continuous thermostat cycling.

    <strong>New regime (cyan):</strong> Only 0.2% of readings are idle. The entire distribution shifted right. A much fatter tail of 1.5&ndash;2.0 kWh readings spanning many more hours.

</div>

<!-- ===== Summary calculation ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">8</span>The Calculation: Where The Extra Energy Goes</h2>
  <div class="calc-box"><span class="highlight">OLD REGIME (Feb&ndash;Mar 2025): 16.2 kWh/day</span>
  Heater (>0.8 kWh readings):   7.5 kWh/day  &bull;  Element on: 2.7 h/day
  Household (≤0.8 kWh readings): 8.7 kWh/day  (low &mdash; still settling in after move-in)

<span class="highlight">NEW REGIME (Dec 2025&ndash;Jan 2026): 26.2 kWh/day</span>
  Heater (>0.8 kWh readings):  15.0 kWh/day  &bull;  Element on: 5.6 h/day
  Household (≤0.8 kWh readings): 11.2 kWh/day  (stable since June &mdash; same as summer)

<span class="highlight">THE GAP: +10.0 kWh/day</span>
  Heater increase:    +7.5 kWh/day  (75% of gap)  &larr; TIMER REGIME CHANGE
  Household increase: +2.5 kWh/day  (25% of gap)  &larr; MOVE-IN SETTLING (not seasonal)

<span class="highlight">WHY DOES THE SAME HEATER USE 2x THE ENERGY?</span>
  Old regime: element enabled ~6 h/day (in cheap-rate windows)
  New regime: element enabled ~20 h/day (24/7 minus 16&ndash;20)

  Old regime: tank held at thermostat setpoint only during windows.
              Between windows, tank cooled freely. No energy consumed.
              Average tank temperature across the day: well BELOW setpoint.
              Lower avg temp &rarr; lower heat loss rate &rarr; less energy needed.

  New regime: tank held at FULL setpoint ~20 hours/day.
              Every temperature dip immediately corrected.
              Average tank temperature across the day: AT or NEAR setpoint.
              Higher avg temp &rarr; higher heat loss rate &rarr; more energy needed.

  The old enforced off-periods acted as free temperature setback.
  The new regime eliminates that setback = more standing losses replenished.

<span class="highlight">ELEMENT POWER IS IDENTICAL IN BOTH REGIMES: ~2.8 kW when firing.</span>
  It's not a different element. Not a changed thermostat. Not more hot water usage.
  It's purely more run-time: 2.7 h/day &rarr; 5.6 h/day.</div>
</div>

<!-- ===== CHART 9: Overnight heatmap ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">9</span>Overnight Heater Activity: Week-by-Week</h2>
  <p class="desc">Average kWh per half-hour slot during the key overnight hours (22:00&ndash;03:00) when the heater fires most. Stacked by hour band &mdash; each column is one week.</p>
  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart9"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Old regime (left):</strong> activity concentrated in the 22:00&ndash;23:00 band (cheap-rate window). Hours 00:00&ndash;03:00 are almost empty.<br>
    <strong>New regime (right):</strong> activity spreads across all overnight hours. The 22:00&ndash;01:00 band lights up as the heater recovers after the 16:00&ndash;20:00 off-window, and stays elevated until 03:00.

<!-- ===== CHART 10: Monthly cost ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">10</span>Monthly Cost: Heater vs Household</h2>
  <p class="desc">Electricity cost in &pound; split by heater readings (&gt;0.8 kWh) and household readings (&le;0.8 kWh). Line shows heater share of total cost.</p>
  <div class="chart-container chart-tall"><canvas id="chart10"></canvas></div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>January 2026 peak:</strong> &pound;177.66 total &mdash; the heater alone cost <strong>&pound;99.20</strong> (56%). In summer, the heater drops to &pound;23&ndash;25/month (29&ndash;33%).<br>
    Despite lower per-kWh Agile rates in new regime (17.4p vs 21.3p), the volume increase overwhelms the rate savings.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===== Section 11: The Price Tag ===== -->
<div class="card">
  <h2><span class="section-num">11</span>The Price Tag: What The Regime Change Costs</h2>
  <div class="calc-box"><span class="highlight">OLD REGIME DAILY COST: &pound;3.28/day</span>
  Heater avg rate when firing: 21.3 p/kWh (mostly evening cheap-rate slots)
  Household avg rate:          22.8 p/kWh

<span class="highlight">NEW REGIME DAILY COST: &pound;4.85/day (+48%)</span>
  Heater avg rate when firing: 17.4 p/kWh (overnight slots &mdash; even cheaper!)
  Household avg rate:          20.2 p/kWh

<span class="highlight">THE PARADOX: cheaper rates, higher bills.</span>
  The new regime fires the heater during cheaper overnight hours (17.4p vs 21.3p),
  BUT the element runs 2x as long (5.6h vs 2.7h), so total cost rises 48%.

<span class="highlight">EXTRA COST OF THE NEW REGIME:</span>
  Per day:   <span class="highlight">+&pound;1.57</span>
  Per month: <span class="highlight">+&pound;47.79</span>
  Per year:  <span class="highlight">+&pound;573</span>

<span class="highlight">ANNUAL ELECTRICITY BREAKDOWN:</span>
  Heater:    &pound;619  (48% of total)
  Household: &pound;659  (52% of total)
  Total:     &pound;1,277</div>
  <div class="insight-box">
    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Reverting to the old timer regime (element enabled only in 2&ndash;3 cheap-rate windows per day) would save roughly <strong>&pound;48/month</strong> or <strong>&pound;573/year</strong> &mdash; with no reduction in usable hot water during the hours that matter.
